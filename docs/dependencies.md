<summary>üìÑ <strong>Full Lua License Text</strong></summary>

```
Lua is free software distributed under the terms of the MIT license 
reproduced here. Lua may be used for any purpose, including commercial 
purposes, at absolutely no cost. No paperwork, no royalties, no GNU-like 
"copyleft" restrictions, either. Just download it and use it.

Lua is certified Open Source software. Its license is simple and liberal 
and is compatible with GPL. Lua is not in the public domain and PUC-Rio 
keeps its copyright.

The spirit of the Lua license is that you are free to use Lua for any 
purpose at no cost without having to ask us. The only requirement is 
that if you do use Lua, then you should give us credit by including 
the copyright notice somewhere in your product or its documentation.
